Allah is \\nAppreciative and Forbearing.  \\n18. The Knower of the Unseen and the Seen, \\nthe Almighty, the Wise.  \\n  \\n65. DIVORCE  \\n(at-Talaq ) \\nIn the name of Allah,  \\nthe Gracious, the Merciful  \\n1. O Prophet! If any of you divorce women, di-\\nvorce them during their period of purity, and \\ncalculate their term. And be pious before Al-\\nlah, your Lord. And do not evict them from \\ntheir homes, nor shall they leave, unless they \\nhave committed a proven adultery. These are \\nthe limits of Allah —whoever oversteps Al-\\nlah’s limits has wronged his own soul. You \\nnever know; Allah may afterwards bring \\nabout a new situation.  \\n2. Once they have reached their term, either \\nretain them honorably, or separate from them honorably. And call to wi tness two just \\npeople from among you, and give upright tes-timony for Allah. By that is exhorted whoever \\nbelieves in Allah and the Last Day. And who-\\never fears Allah —He will make a way out for \\nhim.  \\n3. And will provide for him from where he \\nnever expected. Wh oever relies on Allah —\\nHe will suffice him. Allah will accomplish His \\npurpose. Allah has set a measure to all things.  \\n4. As for those of your women who have \\nreached menopause, if you have any doubts, \\ntheir term shall be three months —and also \\nfor those who have not menstruated. As for \\nthose who are pregnant, their term shall be \\nuntil they have delivered. Whoever fears Al-\\nlah—He will make things easy for him.  \\n5. This is the ordinance of Allah, which He \\nsent down to you. Whoever fears Allah— He \\nwill remit his sin s, and will amplify his re-\\nward.  \\n6. Allow them to reside where you reside, ac-\\ncording to your means, and do not harass them in order to make things difficult for \\nthem. If they are pregnant, spend on them \\nuntil they give birth. And if they nurse your \\ninfant, give them their payment. And con-\\nduct your relation in amity. But if you disa-gree, then let another woman nurse him.  \\n7. The wealthy shall spend according to his \\nmeans; and he whose resources are restricted \\nshall spend according to what Allah has given \\nhim. Allah never burdens a soul beyond what \\nHe has given it. Allah will bring ease after \\nhardship.  \\n8. How many a town defied the command of \\nits Lord and His messengers? So We held it \\nstrictly accountable, and We punished it with \\na dreadful punishment.  \\n9. It tas ted the result of its decisions, and the \\noutcome of its decisions was perdition.  \\n10. Allah has prepared for them a severe retri-\\nbution. So beware of Allah, O you who pos-\\nsess intellect and have faith. Allah has sent \\ndown to you a Reminder.  \\n11. A messenger who recites to you Allah’s \\nVerses, clear and distinct, that he may bring \\nthose who believe and work righteousness \\nfrom darkness into light. Whoever believes in \\nAllah and acts with integrity, He will admit \\nhim into gardens beneath which rivers flow, \\ntherein  to abide forever. Allah has given him \\nan excellent provision.  \\n12. Allah is He Who created seven heavens, \\nand their like of earth. The command de-\\nscends through them, so that you may know \\nthat Allah is Capable of everything, and that \\nAllah Encompasses every thing in knowledge.  \\n  \\n66.

       " 'answer': \"What a wonderful question!\\n\\nThe Quran speaks about the importance of love, loyalty, and commitment in relationships. In this case, you're asking what Allah (God) would do if you were to love someone but then choose to marry someone else.\\n\\nLet's take a closer look at the context:\\n\\n**Divorce (at-Talaq) - Surah 65:1-10**\\n\\nAllah has set out laws for divorce, encouraging Muslims to maintain good relationships and avoid unnecessary conflicts. In verse 1-2, Allah instructs Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) to divorce women during their purity period (menstruation) and calculate the term of the marriage. This emphasizes the importance of treating one's spouse with respect and honor.\\n\\n**Forbidden Things (at-Tahrim) - Surah 66:1-12**\\n\\nIn verse 11, Allah reminds Prophet Muhammad that He has sent down a Reminder (the Quran) to guide people toward righteousness and faith. This includes maintaining good relationships and avoiding harm to others.\\n\\nNow, let's apply these principles to your question:\\n\\n**What if you love someone but choose to marry someone else?**\\n\\nAllah is aware of human nature and understands the complexities of our emotions. If you were to love someone but choose to marry someone else, Allah would not judge you harshly. In fact, the Quran emphasizes the importance of forgiveness and mercy (Rahman and Rahim).\\n\\n**Injustice: Failing to prioritize love and commitment**\\n\\nIf you choose to marry someone else despite loving another person, that could be considered an injustice toward both individuals involved. It's essential to consider the feelings and well-being of those around you when making decisions.\\n\\n**Good deed: Prioritizing loyalty and commitment**\\n\\nOn the other hand, if you were to prioritize love and commitment in your relationships, Allah would appreciate your efforts to maintain good relationships and avoid harm to others. This includes treating all individuals involved with respect, kindness, and compassion.\\n\\nIn conclusion, while Allah would not judge you harshly for loving someone else, prioritizing loyalty and commitment in your relationships is a noble endeavor that reflects the values of compassion, empathy, and forgiveness.\\n\\nMay Allah guide us toward making wise decisions that prioritize love, loyalty, and harmony. ðŸ\\x8f\"}"
